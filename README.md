# React App

Create Your React App by yourself.

## Tools

### Webpack

React app is written in multiple source files. Webpack is needed to bundle them together to single build file.

### Babel

We use newest EcmaScript features. But our app will run on user's web browsers, and have different versions and ES feature supports. Babel let us use ES newest features and make sure our app can run even when our users use old web browsers.

### ESLint

A linter will check our source code, so it can helps us detect error early in development stage. ESlint can also be used to force our team to use particular code style.
